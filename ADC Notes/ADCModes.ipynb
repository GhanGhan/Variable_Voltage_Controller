    "- convert some channels successively\n",
    "- use mode to configure sequence of up to n channels successively with different sampling times and in different orders\n",

    "## Single Channel Continuous Conversion Mode\n",
    "- converts a single channel continously and indefinitely\n",
    "- allows ADC to work in background, the ADC converts the channel continously without any intervention from the CPU\n",
    "- also, DMA can be used in circular mode, thus reducing the CPU load\n",
